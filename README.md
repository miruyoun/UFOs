# UFOs

## Overview
In this analysis, I created a UFO sightings website that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. It website is able to filter the table for a specific date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Using the website, users can type in specific criteria in five search bars to obtain their desired filtered table. The five search criteria are date, city, state, country, and shape.
### Default website

You can type in two or more filter bars to search for a table with multiple criteria, and the table will update automatically as long as the criteria are present in the table. Each filter bar contains a placeholder value, which appears in light gray. As you type, your inputs will automatically filter the table according to your input.
### Example Multiple Search

## Summary
The one drawback of this website site is that once you search for the desired filter, you can only search again within the filtered table you created. If you wanted to go back to the original table or filter a new table, you would have to reload the website. The first recommendation would be to add a reset table button so that users do not have to reload the website each time they want to filter a new table. A second recommendation I would provide is to add a drop-down box to help filter out the table. Users can filter data for each column with a drop-down box and see data for places they were not aware existed.
